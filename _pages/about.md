I'm a second-year PhD student in the Pharmaceutical Health Services, Outcomes and Policy program at the University of Georgia College of Pharmacy. Before pursuing my PhD, I completed a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree from India. 

My previous research has focused on pharmacoepidemiology, cost-effectiveness analyses, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, as well as observational studies.

I am passionate about conducting research that affects patient outcomes and policy. 

I hope to work in the HEOR and RWE domains in the future. I am currently searching for internship opportunities for Summer 2025.

Previous projects
======
Pregnancy and Perinatal Outcomes Following Exposure to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder: An Analysis of FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System)
======

This project looked at data from the FAERS dashboard regarding the safety of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), specifically buprenorphine, methadone, and buprenorphine-naloxone. We found that buprenorphine had better neonatal outcomes compared to methadone, in concordance with previous literature.
We are currently working on expanding this project by adding real-world usage patterns using Merative MarketScan database, in order to provide insight into preferences regarding MOUD usage.

Opioid Use and its Association with Clostridium difficile Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies
======

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that hospitalized patients who are prescribed opioids are at a greater risk of developing Clostridium difficile infection compared to those who are not prescribed opioids.
This finding is particularly important for immunocompromised patients, who are at a greater risk of developing Clostridium difficile infection.
Clinicians should consider this association while prescribing opioids, especially considering the higher opioid prescription rates in the US compared to other countries.

Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Ubrogepant, Rimegepant, and Zavegepant Compared to Usual Care for the Acute Treatment of Migraine
======

A Markov model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the three CGRP antagonist approved for acute treatment of migraine (ubrogepant, rimegepant, and zavegepant) against each other and usual care.
All three gepants were cost-effective compared to usual care under a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000.
Rimegepant was cost-effective compared to ubrogepant and dominated zavegepant, being both more effective and less costly.
