I'm a third-year PhD student in the Pharmaceutical Health Services, Outcomes and Policy program at the University of Georgia College of Pharmacy. 

My previous research has focused on pharmacoepidemiology, cost-effectiveness analyses, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and observational studies.

My dissertation focuses on Non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations.

I am passionate about conducting research that affects patient outcomes and policy. 

I want to work in the HEOR and RWE domains in the future. I am currently searching for internship opportunities for Summer 2026.
