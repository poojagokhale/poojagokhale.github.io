I'm a second-year PhD student in the Pharmaceutical Health Services, Outcomes and Policy program at the University of Georgia College of Pharmacy. Before pursuing my PhD, I completed a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree from India. 

My previous research has focused on pharmacoepidemiology, cost-effectiveness analyses, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, as well as observational studies.

I am passionate about conducting research that affects patient outcomes and policy. 

I hope to work in the HEOR and RWE domains in the future. I am currently searching for internship opportunities for Summer 2025.

Pregnancy and Perinatal Outcomes Following Exposure to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder: An Analysis of FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System)

This project looked at data from the FAERS dashboard regarding the safety of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), specifically buprenorphine, methadone, and buprenorphine-naloxone. We found that buprenorphine had better neonatal outcomes compared to methadone, in concordance with previous literature.
We are currently working on expanding this project by adding real-world usage patterns using Merative MarketScan database, in order to provide insight into preferences regarding MOUD usage.

Opioid Use and its Association with Clostridium difficile Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that hospitalized patients who are prescribed opioids are at a greater risk of developing Clostridium difficile infection compared to those who are not prescribed opioids.
This finding is particularly important for immunocompromised patients, who are at a greater risk of developing Clostridium difficile infection.
Clinicians should consider this association while prescribing opioids, especially considering the higher opioid prescription rates in the US compared to other countries.


Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Ubrogepant, Rimegepant, and Zavegepant Compared to Usual Care for the Acute Treatment of Migraine


A Markov model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the three CGRP antagonist approved for acute treatment of migraine (ubrogepant, rimegepant, and zavegepant) against each other and usual care.
All three gepants were cost-effective compared to usual care under a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000.
Rimegepant was cost-effective compared to ubrogepant and dominated zavegepant, being both more effective and less costly.
